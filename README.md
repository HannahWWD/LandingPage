# Landing Page Project for Udacity
## Hannah Wu

The collapsible Navigation bar is mainly built in app.js.

Navbar is fully responsive in phone, tablet, and PC.

Uncomment the code at the bottom to see the "hide menu while user not scrolling" feature. It is disabled in default since I think it is too redundant in this case.
